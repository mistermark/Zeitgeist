# Zeitgeist

A timeless typographical theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) inspired by the wonderful design and thinking blog [Medium](http://www.medium.com).

## Foundation

For the grid layout and icons I've used the framework [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) including their icons for the social stuff.

## Typography

Both for the header and the body fonts I've used the font [Calluna (sans)](http://www.exljbris.com/calluna.html) hosted on [Typekit](http://typekit.com). By default these are disabled, since you need to host them on Typekit yourself (they're free, so go ahead!). I've set a [Google Font API](http://www.google.com/fonts) hosted font as a fallback.

For the best experience I'd recommend to serve the Calluna font using a trial account on Typekit.
